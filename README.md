# Smart Video Surveillance

## Abstract

This project has a special feature of `smart video transfer and capture` feature. Smart Video Surveillance is capable of enhancing situational awareness across multiple scales of space and time. This project de-scribes mobile based remote control and surveillance architecture. It is very suitable for remote bank monitoring, shop etc. The idea is to set up a mobile with a GSM Modem at banks, shops which can be used to `transmit/receive video/photos and/or commands to and from the administrator/owner`. Once the comparison is done and an intrusion is found, it sends the streamed video from server to remote administrator over android phone, laptop & pc. Admin can then take appropriate action and alert local security.
